This code suffers from a potential race condition.  If `processFile()` is called concurrently from multiple threads or processes, there's a chance that `$fileHandle` might be closed prematurely, leading to inconsistencies and errors. The `flock()` call does offer some level of synchronization, but it's not guaranteed to prevent issues with many simultaneous requests.

```php
<?php
function processFile($filePath) {
  $fileHandle = fopen($filePath, 'r+');
  if ($fileHandle === false) {
    return false; // Handle file opening error
  }

flock($fileHandle, LOCK_EX);

  // ... process the file contents ...

flock($fileHandle, LOCK_UN);
  fclose($fileHandle);
  return true;
}

// Example usage (vulnerable to race condition if called concurrently):
processFile('myFile.txt');
processFile('myFile.txt');
?>
```
